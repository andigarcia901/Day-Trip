# Day-Trip

For the Day-Trip generator, my goal was to practice working thru creating a function that would utilize random selection when the user entered their answer following prompts.  As the user answers questions the code accomodates for "Yes," "No," or any other entry.  I believe my biggest challenge when completing this project was catching the return value at the end of the function.  This project was my first big Python coding project.
